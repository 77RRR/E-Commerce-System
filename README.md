 🛍️ Product and Image-Based Recommendation System

An intelligent hybrid recommendation system that combines product metadata and visual features to suggest relevant products. This system enhances personalization in e-commerce by analyzing both structured attributes and image similarity using machine learning and deep learning
---

## 🚀 Key Features

- 🧠 Product-Based Filtering: Uses metadata like category, brand, and features to recommend relevant items.
- 🖼️ Image-Based Matching: Deep learning (CNN) extracts image features and finds visually similar products.
- 🔄 Hybrid Model: Combines content filtering and image similarity for accurate and diverse recommendations.
- 📱 Interactive UI: Simple web app (Streamlit/Flask) for uploading images or selecting product filters.
- 📦 Modular Codebase: Clean, scalable, and well-structured Python project.

📁 Project Structure

Technologies Used
Programming: Python

ML/DL Libraries: Scikit-learn, TensorFlow/Keras

Image Processing: OpenCV, PIL

Web Framework: Streamlit / Flask

Similarity: Cosine Similarity, K-Nearest Neighbors

CNN Models: Pretrained VGG16 / ResNet for image feature extraction



🛠️ How It Works
🟩 Product-Based Filtering:
Filter products using structured metadata like category, brand, color, etc.

Uses similarity metrics like cosine similarity or distance metrics.

🟨 Image-Based Matching:
Input image is passed through a CNN (e.g., ResNet/VGG16).

Extracted features are compared with existing product image embeddings.

🟦 Hybrid Recommendation:
Scores from product and image match are combined (weighted average).

Top-N similar products are recommended.

🧪 Example Use Cases
E-commerce platforms for fashion or electronics

Visual search engines

Personal shopping assistants

🛤️ Future Enhancements
🧾 Collaborative filtering using user ratings

📡 REST API (FastAPI) integration for real-time use
